Levenshtein Distance
====================

A fun Levenshtein Distance implementation. This algorithm takes two words and compares the number of changes it would take to convert from the first to the second.
This implementation uses a single matrix of size (M+1)x(N+1) where M is length of the first string and N is the length of the second string.
